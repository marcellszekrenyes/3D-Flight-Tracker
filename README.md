# 3D-Flight-Tracker

![Flight Tracker in action](/flightTrackerSample.png)

An interactive 3D flight visualizer built with JavaScript, THREE.js and TWEEN.js.
The aim of this project was learning abot asynchronous JS and API calls, but it have outgrown itself.
I started with implementing a hoverable 3D globe from gps coordinates of country borders from a GEOJSON file.
Originally I was planning a weather map, but after half way in I decided to switch to a flight tracker as it is 
'closely' connected to my work and location.

Currently the page works with historical data from AirLabs, hopefully in the future I will be able to make it more
up to date and possibly implement some new features as I keep learning.

Plans for the near future:
- reduce loading time
- get real time data
- display flight informations
